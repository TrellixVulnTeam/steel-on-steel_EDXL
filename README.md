# Project set up

## SCSS

### To install SCSS packages

**in terminal:**

1. `npm init` and follow the instructions to complete the initial set up
2. ` npm install ` to install all the packages in **package.json** file

### To compile, prefix and build your `CSS` in `main.min.css` file, install **LIVE SASS COMPILER** in your IDE (I am using VS Code) and keep it running in the background

- In your `head.html` file, make sure you have a correct link to your compiled css file.

### To initiate live server in development

- **in terminal type:** `npm start`
